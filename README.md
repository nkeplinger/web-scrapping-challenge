# web-scrapping-challenge
Code to successfully scrape info about mars via Beautifulsoup

All data and output CSV files can be found in the directory `code`

## Part 1: "Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News"

Code for this resolved challenge can be found in `code/part_1_mars_mnews.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook.
All data is scraped via BeautifulSoup from `https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html`

## Part 2: "Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data"

Code for this (mostly) resolved challenge can be found in `code/part2_mars_weather.ipynb`. 
I was not able to resolve "How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year" (10pts). 
All Data is scraped via BautifulSoup from `https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html`

Output data frame of the scraped data was exported and stored here: 'code/Data_From_Mars_webscrape.csv'
